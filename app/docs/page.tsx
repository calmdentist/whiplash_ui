            Whiplash is a novel automated market maker (AMM) designed specifically for the memecoin market. 
            It makes an already volatile asset class even more volatile by combining spot and leverage trading 
            within a unified liquidity framework, requiring zero seed capital for new token launches.
          </p>
          <p>
            By employing the Uniswap V2 style invariant with modifications to accommodate leveraged positions,
            Whiplash enables a novel trading experience while ensuring the underlying AMM remains solvent at all times.

            At the core of Whiplash is a modified Uniswap V2 style AMM with the constant product invariant:
          </p>
          <div className="p-4 bg-secondary/40 rounded-lg text-center font-mono">
            x · y = k
          </div>
          <p>where:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>x represents the reserve of the base asset (stablecoin or SOL)</li>
            <li>y represents the reserve of the memecoin token</li>
            <li>k is a constant value maintained during spot trading</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional AMMs, Whiplash introduces modifications to accommodate leveraged trading and zero seed capital token launches.

          <p>
            The token launch process in Whiplash represents a significant innovation in the AMM space.
            When a new memecoin token is created:
          </p>
          <div className="p-4 bg-secondary/40 rounded-lg font-mono">
            <p>y_total = Total token supply</p>
            <p>y_pool = y_total (100% of tokens in pool)</p>
            <p>x_virtual = Initial virtual base asset reserve</p>
          </div>
          <p>The initial constant product is established as:</p>
          <div className="p-4 bg-secondary/40 rounded-lg text-center font-mono">
            k_initial = x_virtual · y_pool
          </div>
          <p>
            This approach enables token creation without requiring real base asset liquidity, 
            as the token supply is fixed and 100% contained within the liquidity pool at launch.

        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Whiplash introduces a novel approach to leverage trading that modifies the constant product invariant temporarily 
            while positions are open.
          </p>
          <p>When a trader opens a leveraged position with leverage factor L:</p>
          <div className="p-4 bg-secondary/40 rounded-lg font-mono">
            <p>Collateral = c</p>
            <p>Effective trade size = c · L</p>
            <p>Borrowed amount = c · (L - 1)</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The leverage trade is executed as if it were a spot trade with size c · L, but the output tokens 
            are stored in a position manager rather than sent to the user's wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            This operation modifies the constant product value temporarily and will be restored when the 
            position is closed or liquidated.
          </p>
        </div>
      ),
    },
    {
      id: 'liquidation',
      title: 'Liquidation Mechanism',
      content: (
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            The liquidation mechanism in Whiplash is designed to protect the protocol when leveraged positions become underwater.
          </p>
          <p>A position becomes eligible for liquidation when:</p>
          <div className="p-4 bg-secondary/40 rounded-lg text-center font-mono">
            Swapped output &lt; Borrowed amount
          </div>
          <p>
            This indicates that the position can no longer be closed profitably as the output would be less than the borrowed amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liquidations can be performed by any market participant when the AMM price crosses the liquidation price, 
            creating arbitrage opportunities.
          </p>
        </div>

      content: (
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            A unique feature of Whiplash is the "limbo state" for positions that experience extreme price movements.
          </p>
          <p>A position enters limbo when:</p>
          <div className="p-4 bg-secondary/40 rounded-lg font-mono">
            <p>Swapped output &lt; Borrowed amount</p>
            <p>and no liquidator has fulfilled the liquidation</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            This mathematical condition allows for positions to recover from temporary price shocks rather than 
            being forced into immediate liquidation, providing protection against flash crashes and manipulation.

          <p>Whiplash's design provides several important guarantees:</p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Solvency Guarantee</h3>
          <p>
            The solvency of the protocol is guaranteed by the zero-sum nature of the token supply and the constant product invariant.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">No Seed Capital Requirement</h3>
          <p>
            The virtual reserves model eliminates the need for seed capital by ensuring all token supply is in the pool at launch.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Zero Bad Debt Guarantee</h3>
          <p>
            The protocol guarantees zero bad debt through its liquidation and limbo mechanisms. Under no circumstances 
            can a position create a debt that the protocol cannot recover, as the fixed token supply ensures all positions 
            are backed by real tokens.
